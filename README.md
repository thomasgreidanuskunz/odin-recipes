# Odin recipes, my first HTML project ever. 

This will be my very first project, its goal is just to make use of all the html 
skills i have learned so far. Be either my skills or my project impressive or no-
t, that is irrelevant, what counts for now is the making of itself. 


In this project i will: 

1-> Create a boilerplate. 

2-> Add structure to that boilerplate. 

3-> Work with file paths, images, and content.

4-> Utilize tags and create links. 

5-> Learn how to work on a project, from scratch. That is, its first part, HTML. 

By the end, i should have a website. A homepage linked with multiple recipe pages that show information about the recipes.
